# NeuroLog: A Neural-Symbolic System

Live demo: https://msthoma.github.io/neurolog_flutter_demo/

NeuroLog is a neural-symbolic system, based on the paper by Tsamoura & Michael (2020),
[_Neural-Symbolic Integration: A Compositional Perspective_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11926), and 
builds upon the [original implementation](https://bitbucket.org/tsamoura/neurolog/src/master/)
of the system.

This demo, created with Dart/Flutter, shows a simple demonstration of how the system operates after 
an initial training period. It allows users to interact with the system, and by asking their 
feedback, the system is able to improve over time by retraining its underlying neural network.

Created by the [Computational Cognition Lab](https://cognition.ouc.ac.cy/cclab/) at the Open 
University of Cyprus.
